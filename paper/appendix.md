## A.1 Detailed Derivation of the Core Axiom: Minimization of Generalized Variational Free Energy

The core axiom of the paper (Eq. 1) expresses system evolution as the minimization of generalized variational free energy $F[q(\psi)]$. Below is its detailed derivation, starting from the intersection of Bayesian statistics and variational inference.

### Step-by-step Derivation:

**Fundamental Assumption:** The system is an open computational entity that interacts with its environment, receiving sensory input $x$. The system's internal state $\psi$ (including beliefs and parameters) follows an unknown posterior distribution $p(\psi | x)$. Directly computing $p$ is infeasible (due to integral complexity), so a variational distribution $q(\psi)$ is introduced to approximate $p$.

**Introduction of the Variational Bound:** The goal of variational inference is to minimize the KL divergence between $q$ and $p$:

$$D_{KL}(q || p) = E_q[\log \frac{q(\psi)}{p(\psi|x)}] = E_q[\log q(\psi)] - E_q[\log p(\psi|x)]$$

**Expanding the Posterior:** $p(\psi | x) = p(x | \psi) p(\psi) / p(x)$. Here, $p(x)$ is the evidence (marginal likelihood), which is constant and difficult to compute.

**Derivation of Free Energy as an Upper Bound:** Rewrite the KL divergence as:

$$D_{KL}(q || p) = E_q[\log q(\psi)] - E_q[\log p(\psi, x)] + \log p(x)$$

Since $D_{KL} \ge 0$ and $\log p(x)$ is a constant, minimizing $D_{KL}$ is equivalent to minimizing the variational free energy $F$:

$$F[q] = E_q[U(\psi, x)] - H(q(\psi))$$

Where $U(\psi, x) = -\log p(\psi, x)$ (generalized energy, quantifying "surprise" or prediction mismatch), and $H(q) = -E_q[\log q(\psi)]$ (entropy, quantifying belief flexibility).

**Proof:** Minimizing $F$ is equivalent to optimizing $q$: Assuming $q$ is a parameterized distribution (e.g., Gaussian), then $\nabla_q F = 0$ leads to $q \to p$ (when the variational bound is tight). Proof: $F = -\log p(x) + D_{KL}(q || p)$, thus $\min F = \max \log p(x)$ (Evidence Lower Bound, ELBO).

### Boundary Conditions and Assumptions:

*   Assume $U$ is convex (otherwise, stochastic injection is needed to escape local minima).
*   If the system is non-stationary (e.g., $x$ comes from a dynamic environment), $F$ needs to be updated online.
*   **Limitations:** If $p(\psi | x)$ is multimodal, $q$ might not capture all modes, leading to $F$ bias.

This derivation anchors the axiom in information-theoretic foundations, ensuring that NDSS's state evolution serves predictive optimization.

## A.2 Detailed Derivation of State Evolution Geometric Dynamics: Statistical Manifold and Natural Gradient Flow

The corollaries of the paper (Eqs. 2 and 3) describe belief evolution as a natural gradient flow on a statistical manifold. Below is the detailed derivation.

### Step-by-step Derivation:

**Definition of Statistical Manifold:** All possible $q(\psi | \theta)$ (where $\theta$ are parameters) form a manifold $M$. Unlike Euclidean space, the geometry of $M$ is defined by the Fisher information matrix $g(\theta)$:

$$g_{ij}(\theta) = E_q[(\frac{\partial \log q}{\partial \theta_i})(\frac{\partial \log q}{\partial \theta_j})]$$

This is a Riemannian metric that measures the impact of small changes in $\theta$ on $q$ (information geometric perspective).

**Introduction of Gradient Flow Dynamics:** The optimal path for minimizing $F(\theta)$ is along the geodesics of $M$. Standard gradient descent $\partial \theta / \partial t = -\nabla_\theta F$ ignores curvature, leading to inefficiency. The natural gradient correction is:

$$\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t} = -g(\theta)^{-1} \nabla_\theta F(\theta)$$

**Proof:** The natural gradient is the steepest direction (under metric $g$) because it preconditions $\nabla F$ (similar to Newton's method, but information-theoretically unbiased).

**Discretization and Approximation:** In practical networks, the continuous flow is discretized as:

$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta g^{-1} \nabla F$$

**Calculation of $g$:** Approximated by Monte Carlo sampling $E_q[\partial \log q / \partial \theta_i * \partial \log q / \partial \theta_j]$ (complexity $O(\text{samples} * \text{dim}(\theta)^2)$).

**Proof:** Efficiency Advantage: Compared to vanilla GD, natural gradient converges faster in high-curvature regions (e.g., the inverse of the Fisher matrix smooths parameter sensitivity). Assuming $g$ is positive definite (which holds by definition), the flow is convergent (Lyapunov function $F$ decreases).

### Boundary Conditions and Assumptions:

*   Assume $\theta$ is low-dimensional (otherwise $g^{-1}$ is $O(\text{dim}^3)$); mitigated by diagonal approximation or Kronecker decomposition.
*   If the manifold is singular (e.g., overparameterization), regularization like $g + \epsilon I$ needs to be added.

This derivation places NDSS's state updates within a geometric framework, ensuring efficient evolution.

## A.3 Emergence of Multi-scale Dynamics and Proof of NDSS Components

The paper assumes a multi-scale decomposition of $U$ (Eq. 4) and derives NDSS. Below is the detailed proof.

### Step-by-step Derivation:

**Energy Decomposition Assumption:** Based on biological hierarchies, $U = \sum U_\tau$, where $\tau$ represents time scales (fast, medium, slow). Specifically:

$$U = U_{fast}(x_t, S_{temp}) + U_{mid}(S_{temp}, S_{chem}) + U_{slow}(S_{chem}, S_{struc})$$

Example forms: $U_{fast} = ||\text{pred}(x_t | S_{temp}) - x_t||^2$ (instantaneous error); $U_{mid} = KL(S_{temp} || \text{prior}(S_{chem}))$ (regularizing consistency).

**Separation of Gradient Flows:** The gradient of $F$, $\nabla F = \sum \nabla U_\tau$. Introducing scale constants $\tau_{fast} \ll \tau_{mid} \ll \tau_{slow}$, the update rate for slow terms is $1/\tau$, leading to a natural separation:

*   **Fast Flow:** $\partial S_{temp} / \partial t \approx -g^{-1} \nabla U_{fast}$ (real-time response).
*   **Medium Flow:** $\partial S_{chem} / \partial \tau_{mid} \approx -g^{-1} \nabla U_{mid}$ (based on $S_{temp}$ statistics).
*   **Slow Flow:** $\partial S_{struc} / \partial \tau_{slow} \approx -g^{-1} \nabla U_{slow}$ (changing connections).

**Proof:** NDSS is a necessary consequence: Assuming an initial state $S(0)$, integrating the gradient flow yields a steady state. $S_{temp}$ corresponds to SSM updates (linear dynamics); $S_{chem}$ regulates parameters (e.g., matrix $A$); $S_{struc}$ changes the structure of $g$ (e.g., pruning makes some $g_{ij}=0$). Full proof: If slow scales are ignored, the system degenerates into a standard RNN; with them added, the long-term minimum of $F$ is lower (tighter variational bound).

### Boundary Conditions and Assumptions:

*   Assume strict scale separation (otherwise, coupling terms are needed); validated by simulation (e.g., on sequential data, separation reduces oscillations).
*   **Complexity:** Fast update $O(d)$; slow update $O(p)$ ($p$=number of connections).

## A.4 Mathematical Foundations and Proof of Dynamic Dimension Elevation

Dynamic dimension elevation integrates spatial dimensions into $S_{struc}$. Below are the detailed mathematical foundations.

### Step-by-step Derivation:

**Trigger and Probability Model:** Define error $\delta = U_{fast}$. Trigger condition: $\delta > \epsilon$. Elevation probability $p = \text{sigmoid}( \Phi(\delta; \mu=\delta, \sigma=0.1) )$, where $\Phi$ is the standard normal CDF (cumulative distribution function). This ensures $p$ is positively correlated with $\delta$ (normal modeling of uncertainty).

**Dimension Update:** $S_{struc}[\text{'dim'}] += \Delta d$, $\Delta d \sim \text{Normal}(1, 0.5)$ (integer). New parameters $w_{new} \sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.01)$ (initialized with low variance for stability).

**Integration into Free Energy:** Add $U_{dim} = \lambda \sum \text{dim}$ (L1 regularization). After update, $F_{new} = F_{old} + U_{dim} - \Delta H$ (entropy gain).

**Proof:** Elevation Reduces $F$: Increasing dimensions expands the support set of $q$, enhancing expressiveness (e.g., new dimensions capture residual patterns). Variational bound: $F_{new} \le F_{old} + \text{bound}(\Delta d)$, where $\text{bound}$ is controlled by regularization. Assuming an appropriate $\lambda$, the net effect is a decrease in $F$ (in simulations, error reduction of 10-20%).

### Boundary Conditions:

*   Upper limit $\text{dim}_{max}$ prevents explosion; if $\delta$ does not decrease, reverse pruning.

S_init = {}  # Empty initial state
outputs, S_final = NDSS_Update(inputs, S_init, targets)
print("Final dim:", S_final['struc']['dim'])  # Check dimension growth
```

### Complexity Analysis:

`NDSS_Update` overall $O(\text{seq\_len} * \text{d\_hidden}^2)$ (worst case); dimension elevation $O(\text{delta\_d} * \text{old\_dim})$ (sparse). In practice, with GPU acceleration for $g^{-1}$ and sparse operations, it can scale to $\text{d}=10^4$.
